# Anemia Diagnosis Using Fuzzy Logic

A web-based application that uses **fuzzy logic** to diagnose different types of anemia based on clinical blood parameters.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project applies **fuzzy logic principles** to classify anemia types using:

- Hemoglobin (HGB)
- Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
- Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)

The system models real-world medical uncertainty using fuzzy membership functions and rule-based inference.

## 🧠 Anemia Types Diagnosed

- Normal
- Microcytic
- Normocytic
- Macrocytic
- Hypochromic
- Normochromic
- Hyperchromic

- Rule-based fuzzy inference system
- Defuzzification for final diagnosis
- Interactive visualizations of membership functions
- User-friendly web interface for real-time input
